A growing grocery-list tool


This tool is intended to help in my house hold: plan next week's menu, find out what ingredients I need for that, build a grocery list for it.

It also intends to grow knowledge on the way: remember what a typical menu looks like, remember what ingredients are needed for a menu, so that it becomes easier and easier to obtain your next grocery list.


Roadmap
-------

v1. basic grocery list composition 
  a. compose a dish from ingredients
  b. compose a menu from dishes
  c. compose a week menu from menus
  d. compose a grocery list from a week menu
  c. add 'other' items to grocery list

All the entered data should be persistent and editable.

The idea is to run as an in-browser app, using local storage.
